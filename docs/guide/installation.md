# Installation
### Release Notes
Latest stable version: 0.10.0
## Include via script tag
You can inlude Molecule packages via a CDN like [unpkg](https://unpkg.com), which will create the global `Molecule`, or rather the name of the package in PascalCase:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@moleculejs/molecule"></script>
<!-- Or one of the other packages: -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@moleculejs/molecule-lit"></script>
```
## NPM and Yarn
We recommend installation with either NPM or Yarn:
```bash
npm i @moleculejs/molecule
```
```bash
yarn add @moleculejs/molecule
```
